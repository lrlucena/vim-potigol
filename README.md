# vim-potigol

Vim runtime files for the programming language [potigol](http://potigol.github.io)

## What's potigol?

A programming language based of Portuguese keywords.

## Why?

It's a shame that most programming languages are based off English keywords
(i.e. `if`, `else`, `function`, `int`, etc.). I found this language and wanted
to experiment. For me, it's difficult to type some of these words, and I make
lots of mistakes. This plugin provides helpful shortcuts and syntax highlighting
to help me get to where I need to be.
